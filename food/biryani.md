# Biryani

I like biryani. It was my early pandemic comfort food. This biryani is half-decent. You should try it too.

## Ingredients

* 1.5 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces
* 6oz plain yogurt
* 2 tsp Indian chili powder[^1]
* 1 tsp turmeric
* 10 cardamom pods (or an equivalent amount of ground cardamom)
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* Salt
* Ground black pepper
* 1.5 cups basmati rice
* Ghee
* 4 cloves garlic
* 1 cinnamon stick (Ceylon if you can find it, but standard cassia you can find at the grocery store works too)
* 3 anise stars
* 1 bay leaf
* 3 red onions, thinly sliced
* Some fresh mint
* 6 or so green Thai chili peppers

## Steps

### Chicken

1. Put chicken in a bowl, cover with yogurt, and add chili powder, turmeric, cardamom, coriander, salt and pepper to to taste
1. Leave mixture to marinate in the fridge for at least 6 hours, but the longer the better
1. Put chicken and marinade into a pan and cook, covered, until chicken is mostly cooked through
1. Set aside until you're ready to assemble the layers

### Rice

1. Wash rice, then soak in cold water for 30 minutes
1. Bring a few cups of salted water to an aggressive boil in a pot
1. Add rice, pressed garlic, 1 Tbsp ghee, cinnamon stick, star anise, and bay leaf
1. Cook 75% of the way through, then drain the water and set aside until you're ready to assemble the layers

### Onions

1. Toss a pad of ghee into a pan with the onions
1. Season with salt and pepper, then caramelize
1. Set aside until you're ready to assemble the layers

### Finishing

1. Preheat the oven to 350F
1. With a slotted spoon, line the bottom of a glass 9x13 baking pan with the mostly-cooked chicken
2. //TODO: does this amount of food fit in my instant pot?
3. Pour some of the cooking liquid from the chicken pan so that there's around 5mm in the baking pan
4. Mix the rice in with the chicken, including the spices the rice was cooked in
5. Remove the stems from the chilis, cut them in half lengthwise, and distribute them on top of the rice
6. Put some mint leaves on top of that, then spread the red atop that
7. Cover the whole thing with aluminum foil, then bake for 30 minutes
8. Remove, eat, then eat again and again over the next week cuz hot dang it's a lot of food

[^1] n.b. this is different than the chili powder you [put in your chili](https://github.com/karmeleon/recipes/blob/master/food/chili.md)! You can find it in the Indian section of your local grocery store's ethnic food aisle or an Indian grocery store. If you can't find it, ground cayenne works too, but I suggest adding 50% extra (Indian chili powder is spicy!)
