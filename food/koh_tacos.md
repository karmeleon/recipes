Koh tasked me with creating something that included chicken and avocado. I made this. It's pretty good. You should make it too.

### Ingredients

Sauce:

* ¼ cup lime juice
* 3 serrano chiles
* ¼ cup balsamic vinegar
* 2 cloves garlic

Slaw:

* ½ head cabbage, chopped (red or green)
* ¼ cup cilantro, chopped
* ¼ cup white wine vinegar
* 1 red onion
* 1 avocado, diced
* Kosher salt, to taste
* Black pepper, to taste
* Celery salt, to taste

Other:

* 1 lb shredded chicken
* Cumin, to taste
* Chili powder, to taste
* 6 small tortillas
* ½ Tbsp sour cream per taco

### Steps

1. Toss the slaw ingredients together and season to taste.
2. Mix the sauce ingredients in a bowl.
3. Shred the chicken and season it with salt, pepper, cumin, and a touch of chili powder.
4. Assemble tacos and put them in your mouth. Margaritas optional, but recommended.
