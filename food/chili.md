# Netflix and Chili

It's getting about as cold as it ever will be in San Francisco, so it's time to break out the ol' chili recipe. Originally based off of [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14985/its-chili-by-george/), my version is the product of 5 years of more-or-less random permutations that happened to find a local maximum here. It's on the soupier, meatier side, which makes it perfect both on its own or as a dipping sauce for grilled cheese or garlic bread!

### Info

I quite like cooking it with my Instant Pot -- saute the beef on high, drain, then add the rest of the ingredients and slow cook on high for 3+ hours. Pressure cooking it is an option that gets it done faster, but for some reason it isn't as good in my experience. Simmering on a stovetop works too.

Makes about 1.8 quarts, or roughly 5 hearty bowls. Plenty for the whole family! Or Sunday meal prep, or heck, just one huge dinner for yourself. I'm not judging.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
    * 90/10 seems to work well, but if you're making a double batch it doesn't hurt to use a pound of it plus a pound of 80/20.
    * You can also substitute in a plant-based beef substitute if you're vegetarian/vegan, but after trying all the options at Safeway I can confidently say the real stuff tastes better.
* 3 sprigs fresh rosemary
* salt
* black pepper
* 22 oz tomato juice
* 15 oz tomato sauce
* 15 oz red kidney beans, liquid lazily poured down the sink
* 1 yellow onion, diced
* Chili peppers:
    * 2 red Fresno peppers, minced + to taste (substitute 1-2 habaneros if you can't find Fresnos)
    * 4 small serrano peppers, minced + to taste
* ½ tsp ground cayenne pepper
* ½ tsp ancho chili powder
* ¼ tsp cinnamon
* ¼ tsp dried oregano
* ¾ tsp cumin
* 2.5 tbsp chili powder
* 1½ tsp brown sugar
* 1 bay leaf

### Steps

1. Brown and crumble the ground beef in a pot with the rosemary sprigs as you season it with salt and pepper.
2. Drain the grease from the pot, but keep the rosemary sprigs.
3. Toss the veggies, tomato juice and sauce, and remaining spices into the pot.
4. Raise the pot to a simmer.
5. Taste it! If it's not spicy enough (chili peppers vary in spiciness, after all) feel free to add another chili to fine-tune the heat.
6. Simmer for at least 2½ hours total or slow cook for at least 3 hours (but more is better!).
7. Serve with whatever chili toppings you like.
