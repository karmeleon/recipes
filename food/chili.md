It's getting about as cold as it ever will in San Francisco, so it's time to break out the ol' chili recipe. This one's based off [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/14985/its-chili-by-george/), with reckless modifications made. It's also spicy as hell, so uh, be careful.

### Ingredients

* 1 lb ground beef
* 22 oz tomato juice
* 15 oz tomato sauce
* 15 oz pinto beans, drained and rinsed
* ½ yellow onion, diced
* 3 habanero peppers, minced
* 4 small serrano peppers, minced
* ½ tsp ground cayenne pepper
* ¼ tsp cinnamon
* ¼ tsp dried oregano
* ¾ tsp cumin
* 2 tbsp chili powder
* ½ tsp white sugar
* salt
* black pepper
* rosemary

### Steps

1. Toss the veggies, tomato juice and sauce, and non-rosemary spices into a pot.
2. Add salt and pepper to taste.
3. Brown and crumble the ground beef as you season it with salt, pepper, and rosemary in the pan.
4. Add the lamb to the pot, discarding the grease.
5. Simmer for at least 3 hours.
6. Serve with whatever chili toppings you like
