# Korean-ish Fries

## Observation

i want fries

## Hypothesis

by combining this crap i found in my kitchen in roughly these proportions, scaled relative to taste:

* 1 dinner plate of fries;
* 1.5 tsp gochujang;
* 1 tsp kewpie mayo (regular mayo works too) + more to squiggle on top;
* 1 tsp water;
* 1.5 tsp smoked sea salt (flaky salt and a spritz of liquid smoke should work too);
* 1 tsp gochugaru;
* chopped scallion greens;

i will have fries that are good.

## Procedure

1. cook fries as normal, but do not add any salt -- i used frozen cuz i'm a lazy ass
2. arrange (dump) fries onto your most instagrammable plate
3. in your tiniest bowl, whisk together gochujang with just enough mayo and water so that it's pourable
4. layer gochujang sauce and a zigzag of mayo over the fries
5. sprinkle smoked sea salt, gochugaru, and green onions to taste and visual appeal

## Analysis

these fries are ballin. i didn't have any bulgogi in the fridge, but the smoky salt and gochujang kind of made it taste like i did. things i would add if i had them handy:

* bulgogi or spicy pork
* bacon (top with regular sea salt instead, bacon should provide smokiness)
* fried kimchi
* a blowtorched mozzarella topping
* corn cheese
* furikake maybe?
