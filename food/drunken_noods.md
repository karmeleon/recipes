# Drunken Noodles

Currently a mix of [these](https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/drunken-noodles/) two [recipes](https://www.recipetineats.com/pad-kee-mao-thai-drunken-noodles/) I found online. Work in progress!

## Ingredients
* 7oz / 200g-ish flat rice noodles (pad thai noodles work, but the wider the better)
* Neutral oil
* 3 large cloves garlic, minced
* 3 bird's eye chilis (or 2 habaneros) minced, seeds removed if you don't want too much spice
* 1 small onion, sliced
* 1 green bell pepper, thinly sliced
* 2 green onions, sliced and the whites separated from the greens
* 2 carrots, thinly sliced
* 7oz / 200g-ish chicken thigh cut into thin, bite-size slices (breast works too)
* Black pepper, to taste
* 1 cup Holy Thai basil leaves, roughly chopped (normal basil works too if you can't find it)

### saus
* 3 Tbsp oyster sauce
* 3 Tbsp soy sauce
* 2 tsp brown sugar
* 3 tsp fish sauce
* 1 Tbsp water

## what to do
1. Mix all the sauce ingredients together in a bowl and set aside.
2. Soak and drain the noodles according to the directions on the box. I suggest breaking the noodles in half; it makes it easier to mix in the veggies.
3. Heat up, like, a tablespoon of oil in a wok (or a cast iron pan if you're an electric stove pleb like me).
4. Toss in the garlic and chilis and cook for 10 seconds. This will release a cloud of tear gas. Hold your breath, turn on your stove fan, and hope for the best.
5. Add the onion, carrot, the whites of the green onions, and bell peppers, cook for 1 minute.
6. Add the chicken, grind on some black pepper, and stir fry until mostly cooked, about 2 minutes depending on how thinly you sliced it.
7. Throw in the noodles and sauce; stir and cook until the noodles have absorbed most of the sauce.
8. Remove from heat and mix in the basil and the greens of the green onions.
9. Serve immediately (or after leaving it in the fridge for a couple days, you do you)
