For those days where you don't want to put more than 5 minutes into making dinner, but don't mind waiting an hour for it to be ready. This recipe yields far greater results than you really deserve, given the amount of effort you put into it.

### Ingredients

![Ingredients](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karmeleon/recipes/master/images/thai_chicken_ingredients.jpg)

* 1/2 lb chicken thighs, frozen or refrigerated (or one chicken breast, but thighs are more easily coated in the flavor and have more flavor)
* Salt and pepper to taste
* 2 tsp red curry paste
* 2 tsp lime juice
* 2 tbsp Thai chili sauce
* ½ cup uncooked rice

### Steps

1. Wash the chicken breast, then pat it dry.
2. Season both sides with salt and pepper.
3. Coat all sides with the curry paste. Depending on the size of the breast, you may need to use more than the listed amount. Don't be stingy!
4. Put the chicken in your sous vide bag.
5. Pour in the chili sauce, then roughly coat the chicken in it.
6. Add the lime juice.
7. Seal the bag with the method of your choice, then deposit it in the sous vide water.
8. Cook for 1 hour at 150°F if the chicken was refrigerated, or 1½ hours from frozen.
9. Serve the chicken over rice and pour the remaining sauce over it from the bag.
