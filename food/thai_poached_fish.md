_my plating is horrible, don't do this lol_

I learned that you can poach fish in coconut milk, so I did it.

### Ingredients

* Neutral cooking oil
* 3 shallots, chopped into ~5mm cubes
* 3 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 Tbsp ginger, minced or grated
* 5 red Thai chilis, minced
* 2 limes
* 3 sprigs Thai basil
* 1 can coconut milk
* Fish sauce to taste
* 2 stalks lemongrass
* Brown sugar to taste
* Salt
* Black pepper
* 2 filets of white fish (I used sea bass, but I don't know enough about fish to say what would be best)

### Steps

1. Add some oil to a frying pan and mostly caramelize the shallots.
1. When they're close to being done, add the garlic, ginger, and chilis.
1. Once everything smells good, add coconut milk, 2/3 of the Thai basil leaves, and fish sauce.
1. Zest lime and reserve for garnish, then juice limes into the pan.
1. Chop the ends off the lemongrass, remove the outermost woody layers, cut into ~3 inch pieces, beat them with a meat tenderizer to release the oils, then add to the pan.
1. Cover and bring to a low simmer for five minutes or so, constantly tasting and adding brown sugar and fish sauce to taste.
1. Once things start to look and taste like a curry, season the fish filets with salt and pepper, then slide into the liquid skin side down.
1. Place the rest of your basil on top of the fish, spoon some curry over top, then cover and cook for ~5 minutes.
1. Flip, spoon more curry on top, cook for 5 minutes more, and check the internal temperature if you're a fish cooking noob like me.
1. Once it's fully cooked, remove the fish to a plate.
1. Strain the curry into a pot, reserving both the liquids and solids.
1. Place each filet in a shallow dish along with half the liquid and curry solids, then garnish with lime zest, finely-sliced basil ribbons, and a few thin slices of red chili.
