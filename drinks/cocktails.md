# Cocktails

Their actual names are not `Cocktail${i++}`, but I'm much better with booze than naming.

### Cocktail 1

1.5oz vodka

2d Peychaud's bitters

.75oz sweet vermouth


Stir with ice, serve up.

### Bad Hombre

I was feeling a little down after the elections, so I made this as catharsis. Probably should've made it stronger given the circumstances, but it turned out pretty well.

1.5oz tequila

.75oz lime juice

.75oz simple syrup

1d hot sauce (ideally habanero-based, but anything works)

.5tsp salt

Shake with ice, serve up.

### Seafall

Named after the board game I was playing when I made it. Very sweet.

1.5oz Kraken black rum

.75oz Midori melon liqueur

.75oz lemon juice

2d Peychaud's bitters

Shake with ice, serve up.

Some weird bastardization of an Old Fashioned. Don't consume around anyone who gives a shit about keeping cocktails pure.

2d Peychaud's

Stir with ice, serve in an old fashioned glass.
