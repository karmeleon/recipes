# Cocktails

Their actual names are not `Cocktail${i++}`, but I'm much better with booze than naming.

### Cocktail 1

1.5oz vodka

2d Peychaud's bitters

.75oz sweet vermouth


Stir with ice, serve up.

.75oz simple syrup

1d hot sauce (ideally habanero-based, but anything works)

.5tsp salt

Shake with ice, serve up.

### Seafall

Named after the board game I was playing when I made it. Very sweet.

1.5oz Kraken black rum

.75oz Midori melon liqueur

.75oz lemon juice

2d Peychaud's bitters

Shake with ice, serve up.
